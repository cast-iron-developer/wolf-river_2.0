                    <p>
                        Starting with a new therapist can be a difficult
                        decision. Knowing what to expect can reduce some of the
                        anxiety about the initial meeting. I take the first
                        session to extensively review the history of the
                        client’s symptoms by asking a series of questions about
                        their current functioning and history, sometimes dating
                        back to early childhood. While this may seem daunting,
                        the initial interview allows me to get a good
                        understanding of how a client’s difficulties developed,
                        and to understand how they are coping at present. Once
                        the interview is complete, I work collaboratively with
                        the patient to develop an individualized treatment plan,
                        including the estimated number of sessions, treatment
                        approach and expectations for the course of therapy.
                        Expect the initial session to take 60-90 minutes.

                        The primary treatment used to treat anxiety is Cognitive
                        Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, or CBT-I. This approach
                        uses a combination of education, behavior change, coping
                        skills and sleep prescription to increase sleep
                        efficiency. It typically requires 5-8 sessions to
                        complete a course of CBT-I.

                        The most effective treatment for OCD to date is
                        Exposures and Response Prevention, or ERP. This
                        treatment combines in-session learning and support with
                        out-of-session assignments to target both obsessive
                        thoughts and compulsive behaviors. More specifics on
                        this complex treatment can be found at IOCDF.org.
                        Additional treatments are available for OCD related
                        disorders such as ARFID and Tourette’s.

                        The primary treatment utilized for these disorders is
                        Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This broad category of
                        therapies focuses on the ways in which thoughts,
                        behaviors and emotions interact to create new patterns
                        of thoughts and coping skills. Treatment length varies
                        and the specifics of treatment will be determined by the
                        client’s individual symptoms.

                        treatment. As a result, there are several important

                            In order to get a thorough understanding of the
                            client’s symptoms and struggles, a clinical
                            interview is conducted. During this interview, the
                            client may be asked some difficult questions about
                            their current functioning, as well as their history
                            dating back to childhood. This information helps the
                            therapist get to know the client, and to understand
                            their individual needs.

                            information gathered in the clinical interview.
                            Creating this plan is a collaborative process
                            between therapist and client. The final plan should
                            be comprised of the evidence–based approach that has
                            the best chance of helping the client reach their

                            The client and the therapist must determine together

                            to proceed with therapy. While it often takes time

                            begins in the first session. If the client or

                            a different setting, alternative referrals will be
