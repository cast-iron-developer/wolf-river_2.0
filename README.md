# I made the change because Gatsby went from HERO to ZERO

The first iteration of this version of the site was started with Gatsby V2 sometime last year. Due to life catching up with me, I worked on this site sporadically throughout the last calendar year. I took a couple of months off back in May/April. When I picked it back up a couple weeks ago, I decided to migrate to Gatsby V3. Unfortunately the breaking changes would have necessitate redoing a lot of my CSS Modules and online research into the exact issues I was facing resulted in little help. Rather than waste time chasing a goose, I opted to instead migrate to NextJS. That was 8/9/2021. At the time of this writing it is 8/10/2021 and the site is around 85-90% migrated. Gatsby, you're the worst.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
